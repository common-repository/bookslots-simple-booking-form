#### SCHEDULING PROCESSES AND OPERATION:

Set your schedule (Once-off configuration) -

Set it up yourself, and let us know when you're free. Add your staff, employees, or anything else you want to call it (WordPress user).

The availability type and the designated time of availability can both be changed.

Hairstyling services is one type of service you could offer, and consultations are often set up.

With the help of the booking form on your WordPress posts or pages using the shortcode **[bookslots-form]**, your clients can make appointments.

Your customers won't need to send emails to set up a meeting since they can use the booking form on your tailored posts or pages to do it instantly.

They select a practical time window that works for both parties involved -

Your clients may choose an open slot by picking a desired day and time that corresponds to your designated time of availability.

Yay! Your appointment is set. –

No synchronizing calendars or exchanging emails.

Never again ask what day or time they are available.
